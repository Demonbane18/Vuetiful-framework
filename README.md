If you've downloaded/clone the repository, before you run the project you will have to install the dependencies again
using 
<pre><code>npm install

If you can't serve the web app, you are probably doing it on the wrong directory. Please use
<pre><code>cd modal project
</code></pre>
to access the directory with all the files.
